# Introduction
Our AR indoor navigation project was developed based on Unity to instruct users on how to travel within the environment of a given building. We started with a simple scene modeling in this checkpoint instead of an entire building interior environment to test if the base code works properly. Once the modeling was complete, we added the target object (i.e., destination) to the environment. We then added a short script to unity, which was to set the navigation target and add two references to it, one for the top-down camera and the other for the navigation target object. Unfortunately, we had problems running the source code, and the two references did not show up even after debugging. We will continue to try to solve this problem by other methods.

# Unfinish part
We plan to perform a complete scan and build a map of the LSC for the next phase by using “Meshroom” software once the source code is operational and the usage scenario is selected. Then, we will add functions such as destination search and distance planning to the source code to improve the software's functionality further.

# Related Experiment
We will design an experiment to test the practicality of our AR indoor navigation application. The experimenters will be divided into two parts. In the case of ensuring that they are not familiar with our preset maps, part of the experimenters can only reach the designated place through the signs in the building, and the other part can use AR indoor navigation to find a destination. We will compare the time taken by the two groups to reach the destination to analyze whether AR indoor navigation is practical, in other words, whether the user can get to the goal faster.
